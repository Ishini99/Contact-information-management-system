# Contact-information-management-system
This project is a Contact Information Management System built using Java and MySQL in the NetBeans IDE. It enables users to manage contact details for friends, colleagues, and family, including addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. In this project, I connected Java to MySQL for secure data storage, implemented essential components like sign-up and login forms for user authentication, and performed CRUD operations  on contact records in a MySQL database. The application dynamically displays data using Java Swing components, JTable, and JComboBox, with support for image handling. Key Java Swing components utilized include JFrame, JPanel, JTextField, JButton, JTable, JLabel, JDateChooser, JComboBox, and JTextArea. The projectâ€™s features encompass user authentication, database operations, JTable integration, image handling, and search and filter functionality, along with UI components that populate JComboBox and display selected JTable data in text fields. The tools used include the Java programming language, NetBeans IDE, and XAMPP for MySQL and phpMyAdmin, making this project a practical example of integrating Java Swing with MySQL for effective data management applications.
